I'm a bad student but in a good way (at least I tell myself that). I finished my Sinatra project over a month ago but I am just now writing my blog post about it. Why you might ask? Well, it's partly because I hate blogging but more on account  of Rails being the next module and I was eager to start the real deal. Since I am a bad student and I didn't blog in a timely manner this post is kind of weird because I can remember how memorized I was with Sinatra when I was going through but I also have the knowledge from spending a month in the Rails world and now I am not as impressed.
	When I was using Sinatra I remember thinking “how could Rails be any better/easier than this does it write the app for you?” and then I met the scaffold generator. I know I know the scaffold generator is a big no no but it still makes me laugh when I think back to my state of mind while learning Sinatra. I am glad I learned it because it gives me a greater appreciation for what Rails prepackages for you and it also teaches/prepares you how to change a Rails built in convention when/if the time arises. I enjoyed my time in Sinatra a lot and couldn’t believe how easy it was to wire up a route but now I really can’t imagine having to do half the boilerplate things I did back then. On that note I have to say it was fun while it lasted Sinatra but I won’t miss you, goodbye.
